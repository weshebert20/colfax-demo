# Knowlton JS Framework

The Knowlton JS framework is a simple collection of Sites and Compoments using jQuery. It is intended to easily support configurations for multiple sites, each with a different set of components.

All base functionality for the framework is located in `app/classes`, all available components in `app/components` and site configurations in `app/sites`.

Additional documentation for each component is provided with JSDoc
